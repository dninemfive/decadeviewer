Little GUI program which visualizes music stats, currently the proportion of songs per decade, which can be weighted by number of songs, number of albums, or playback duration. Inspired by [this thread](https://rateyourmusic.com/discussion/music/what-does-your-decade-distribution-look-like) on RYM.
